# SPD 1.3 Team Software Project

## Course Description

This course focuses on the foundational skills of successful engineering teams. Students work in teams of four to conduct weekly sprints and retrospectives. Topics include: SCRUM planning, meeting management, delegation, conflict resolution, role ownership, advanced Git & GitHub, Unix Utilities, performance reviews, basics of organizational psychology and team development. Students utilize all the skills they've developed in SPD thus far to ship a sophisticated multi-feature software product that solves a real world problem.

## Why you should learn this

Think Big. After winter break, core curriculum focuses on a big group project with teams of 4-5 engineers. You'll specialize in a particular role (mobile, front end, back end, devices, etc) and execute an ambitious project to impact the world. Previous projects include:
  - A website, designed in partnership with the White House, to educate and connect underserved communities to the Internet.
  - An online marketplace to find and purchase IOT home appliances.
  - A "smart curriculum" that creates tests off of student work.

Your team will dive deep into the nuance of an industry, talk with experts in the field, and create something meaningful. We'll cover organizational psychology research on what makes teams thrive. You'll get hands on experience navigating team dynamics and troubleshooting common communication challenges. SPD 1.3 culminates with Demo presentations of shipped product. It's a stellar opportunity to showcase your work to the larger Make School network and share what you've learned.

Led by the PM. Team checks their roadmap and evaluate teams’ needs to decide what goes into the next sprint, and assign tasks. Teams can use [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) to estimate task effort. Everything is logged into Trello. You can copy this [Sprint Planning Trello Board template](https://trello.com/b/AU9r774H/kanban-board-template).
- **Sprint Retrospective (½ hour, weekly)** - *[Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.10t6cnudbcpw)*. Complete the old sprint board by checking all tickets and moving incomplete ones over to the next sprint board. Then estimate the tickets that the PM have moved into the board ahead of meeting. Go over what was completed, what went well not if it didn’t go so well, but double check how everyone felt. Anyone feel overloaded on work? Anything the PM could have done differently?
