# Agile Project Managmenet Pt 2: Sprint 1 Retrospective & Sprint 2 planning ([Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JsqI_SFi1245W0hwrMXbCA7SB1LdXsDuVqF_TM-6DVk/edit#slide=id.g4f4925853e_0_9))
  - **In Class Activities**
    - *Sprint Retrospectives* - Each Sprint ends with a "Sprint Retrospective" in which teammates reflect on their previous sprint's performance, discuss any team issues that arose, and add new "tickets" to the backlog. You can think of "Sprint Planning" as deciding what to build and the "Sprint Retrospective" as reflecting on how the team can collaborate better. Remember to use the [Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.10t6cnudbcpw) and the [Sprint Retrospective Trello Board Template](https://trello.com/b/8tEv8Uaj/eng-retro-board-template) to follow best practices.
    - *Sprint 2 Planning* - Time to plan your next sprint with your team!
  - **After Class** - 1) Work on your next deliverable - v1 of your product due next Wednesday. Check out the assignment in the assignements folder of this syllabus for further details
