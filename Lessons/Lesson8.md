# Conflict Resolution & Feedback ([Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDmDOus1HOBoKHEIqlkAzCBclV9KVbZD4a4ZrNOiNlc/edit#slide=id.g4fae02da52_0_33))

## Objectives
 - Accurately estimate points and velocity on your engineering team to maximize team work utilization
 - Navigate challenging feedback scenarios in a way that delivers constructive feedback and affirms your teammate
 - Resolve conflicts with teammates

## Revisiting Point Estimations

- Point estimations are a way for engineers to estimate how long something will take to finish
- They're not meant to be held against you, it’s a learning opportunity, and they will help you and your team grow
- They're a life-skill: you will do this wherever you work as a software engineer, from startups to corporations

### Why should I do them?

- They're not binding time constraints, they're guesses on how hard a task is to complete
- They're used to help track how much your team can get done in a sprint. Knowing how many points your team can get done in a sprint is known as **velocity**, and is what engineering teams use to know how much work to pull into a sprint
- These also helo you track how much you can get done, as well as how to eyeball how difficult something is
- It will take a while to get good at it. The more you do it, the better at it you'll get.

### How do I do it?

Story points are typically chosen using the Fibonacci sequence, as it’s easier to pick an estimate than with a linear sequence. For example, it's easier to pick 5 or 8 instead of 5, 6, 7, or 8.

Typically we use the following for point numbers. Where 0.5 (yes it's not Fibonacci, just go with it!) is a dead simple task, and 13 is a really hard task that will most likely take longer than a sprint to do. Anything 13 or higher should be broken up into smaller, more digestable tickets.

Numbers typically used:
- 0.5
- 1
- 3
- 5
- 8
- 13

## In Class Activities

- *Feedback challenge* - discuss your comfort level on giving and recieving feedback and create a "playbook" for specific feedback challenges
- *Lara Framework challenge* - brainstorm challenging conversations scenarios you face on your team and use the LARA framework to craft a message that affirms their perspective and constructively shares your perspective

## After Class

  1. continue conducting sprint
  1. finish v2 of your product by Wednesday (tomorrow) view the [assignemnt](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/SPD-1.3-Team-Software-Project/blob/master/Assignments/02-product-v-1-2-3.md) for more details
